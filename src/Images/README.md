# midi-pictures
Pictures of the 128 standard instruments on MIDI piano keyboards, with CC licensing from Wikimedia Commons.
Useful for programs that implement MIDI instruments, such as MIDI.js, and want a sample picture of each one.
Images significantly larger than 2000x2000px have been reduced from the original file. The address of the original file is given in the tab-delimited file index.txt.

For a live menu-based view of the library, go to http://www.picatino.com/piano_typewriter/greensleeves/ and **Change MIDI Instrument** at the top. When you hover over each instrument in the menu, a preview of the picture will load in the background. There are all 128 instruments broken down by 16 categories.
